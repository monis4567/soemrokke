Read 1587266 BAM records:
  kept 486060 primary alignments (33.2%), of which 0 reverse reads
  skipped 732574 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (50.0%)
  skipped 245907 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (16.8%)
  skipped 0 unmapped reads (0.0%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 17067.4 records/sample (2957-56359)
    kept 13.8%-43.1% of these

Built 2147 loci comprising 486060 forward reads and 0 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 0.0 (sd: nan).

Genotyped 2147 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=51.5x, stdev=17.8x, min=19.9x, max=116.4x
  mean number of sites per locus: 113.5
  a consistent phasing was found for 320 of out 330 (97.0%) diploid loci needing phasing
